**Goal:** Reduce churn, maximize LTV

**Tactics:**

---

## 3. Paywall Placement Strategy

### Research-Backed Placement Approach

**Primary Paywall Moments:**
1. **During/After Onboarding** (50% of trial starts happen here)
2. **Before Using Locked Features** (contextual trigger)
3. **After Achievement Moments** (completed first week, PR achieved)
4. **On Every App Open** (for non-subscribers - soft prompt)

### Winning Strategy: Early + Contextual

**Case Study - FitnessAI:**
- Moved paywall to **before onboarding** + added video
- Result: **50% more users saw paywall**
- Result: **2x install-to-trial conversions**
- Result: **Trial-to-paid stayed same** (no negative impact)
- **Total: Revenue doubled**

### Implementation Plan

#### **Option A: Aggressive Early Monetization** (Higher Revenue)
1. **App Install → Welcome screen**
2. **Value proposition video** (30-45 seconds)

4. **Skip option** (bottom, subtle)
5. **Core onboarding for those who skip**

**Pros:**

- Captures highly motivated users immediately

2. **First workout completion**
3. **Immediate value delivery**
4. **Paywall on Day 3-4** (after habit formation begins)
5. **Contextual paywalls** on premium feature access

**Pros:**
- Better user experience perception
- Allows users to experience core value
- Builds trust before asking for money

**Cons:**
- Potential revenue left on table
- Some users may never engage enough to convert

---

### **RECOMMENDED: Hybrid Approach**

**For New Users (First-Time Installers):**
- Show soft paywall **immediately after onboarding** (Day 0)
- Emphasize free trial (7 days, no credit card)

- **Trial users:** 3x during trial (Days 1, 4, 7)
- **Lapsed subscribers:** On login + contextual triggers

---

## 4. Trial Strategy Analysis

### 7-Day Free Trial vs. No Trial

#### **Data-Driven Decision:**

**7-Day Free Trial (RECOMMENDED)**
- **Conversion Rate:** 45% (for 5-9 day trials)
- **User Psychology:** Risk-free, allows full feature exploration
- **LTV Impact:** Moderate (users commit after experiencing value)
- **Best For:** Feature-rich apps requiring behavior change

**No Trial (Direct Purchase)**
- **Conversion Rate:** Lower volume, but 2x LTV per customer
- **LTV Impact:** $60 vs $35-40 (70% increase)
- **User Psychology:** Self-selects highly motivated users
- **Best For:** Established brands with strong value proposition

### Progressive Disclosure Strategy

**Timing is Critical** - Don't upsell too early

**Month 1:** Focus on activation and habit formation
- **Goal:** Get them using Premium consistently
- **Upsells:** None - let them discover value
- **Messaging:** Feature education, quick wins

**Month 2-3:** Introduce next-level concepts
- **Goal:** Deepen engagement, show what's possible
- **Upsells:** Soft mentions of coaching in AI tips
- **Messaging:** "Imagine having a personal coach..."

**Month 4+:** Active upsell to Premium+
- **Goal:** Convert power users to highest tier
- **Upsells:** Direct offers, free coaching session trials
- **Messaging:** Results-focused, testimonials, FOMO

---

### Upsell Messaging Best Practices

**DO:**
✅ Target power users (5+ workouts/week)
✅ Trigger prompts based on behavior (not just time)
✅ Demonstrate value before asking (previews, trials)
✅ Use social proof ("10,000 players upgraded this month")
✅ Make it contextual (show coaching upsell after plateau)
✅ Emphasize outcomes ("Improve 3x faster" not "Get coaching")

**DON'T:**
❌ Upsell too early (under 2 weeks usage)
❌ Interrupt active workouts (bad UX)
❌ Use fear-based messaging ("You're falling behind")
❌ Spam with constant prompts (max 1x per week)
❌ Hide features without explanation (show locked features)
❌ Offer discounts to new upgrades (trains bad behavior)

---

### Push Notification Strategy (90% Open Rate)

**Types of Upsell Notifications:**

**Behavior-Triggered:**
- "You've completed 10 workouts! 🎉 Unlock AI coaching to accelerate progress"
- "New personal record! Premium users get detailed performance analytics"
- "3-day workout streak! Keep it going with Premium's advanced programs"

**Time-Based:**
- "Last day of 7-day trial - continue your progress with Premium"
- "Pre-season starts in 30 days - get coaching to dominate tryouts"
- "You've been with us for 3 months - ready for 1-on-1 coaching?"

**Feature-Discovery:**
- "New: AI video analysis is here - Premium users try it first"
- "Check out what Premium users are saying about the AI coach 💬"
- "Limited time: Annual Premium 20% off this weekend only"

**Best Practices:**
- Send at optimal times: 6-8 AM (before workout) or 5-7 PM (after work)
- Limit to 2-3 upsell notifications per week max
- A/B test messaging (value vs. urgency vs. social proof)
- Personalize based on player type ("Defensemen love this feature...")

### Feature Gating Principles

#### **1. Core Loop Must Be Free**
The essential user experience should work without payment:
- Log workout ✅
- See progress ✅
- Set goals ✅
- Get basic value ✅

#### **2. Premium Adds Acceleration**
Free users can succeed, Premium users succeed faster:
- Free: Manual workout planning → Works but slow
- Premium: AI recommendations → Same result, less effort, better optimization

#### **3. Don't Gate Core Social Features**
- Free: View community, follow friends ✅
- Premium: Post and engage ✅
- Rationale: Social features drive retention and word-of-mouth

#### **4. Use Soft Paywalls (Previews)**
- Show what's behind the paywall (blurred AI recommendations)
- "You could unlock this with Premium"
- Builds desire without frustrating users

#### **5. Graduated Limits (Not Hard Walls)**
- Free: 3 custom routines (functional but constrained)
- Premium: Unlimited routines (removes friction)
- Better than: Free = 0 routines (pure paywall)

---

### A/B Testing Recommendations

**Test These Feature Gates:**

**Experiment 1: Custom Routine Limit**
- Variant A: 3 custom routines (current)
- Variant B: 5 custom routines
- Variant C: 10 custom routines
- **Hypothesis:** Higher limit = better retention, but lower conversion

**Experiment 2: AI Feature Access**
- Variant A: No AI preview (hard paywall)
- Variant B: 3 AI recommendations/week (soft limit)
- Variant C: AI previews shown but blurred (tease)
- **Hypothesis:** Previews drive highest conversion

**Experiment 3: Exercise Library**
- Variant A: 100 exercises free (current)
- Variant B: 50 exercises free (tighter gate)
- Variant C: Full library free, but AI selection is Premium
- **Hypothesis:** B drives higher conversion, C drives better retention

**Measure:**
- Free-to-Premium conversion rate
- Day 30 retention (does gate frustrate?)
- Feature engagement (are people using what's gated?)
- Customer feedback (qualitative data)

### Unit Economics (Break-Even Analysis)

**Key Metrics:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Blended CAC** | $3.50 (mid-range) |
| **Premium ARPU** | $11.00/month |
| **Premium+ ARPU** | $199/month |
| **Blended ARPU** | $13.50/month (weighted avg) |
| **Gross Margin** | 85% (after hosting, processing fees) |
| **Churn Rate** | 6% monthly (optimized) |
| **LTV (Premium)** | $155 (at 6% churn, 85% margin) |
| **LTV (Premium+)** | $2,824 (at 3% churn, 85% margin) |
| **Blended LTV** | $190 (weighted average) |

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**
- **Premium Only:** $155 ÷ $3.50 = **44:1** (excellent)
- **Blended (with Premium+):** $190 ÷ $3.50 = **54:1** (exceptional)

**Payback Period:**
- Premium CAC ($3.50) ÷ Monthly Profit ($9.35) = **0.37 months** (~11 days)

**Interpretation:**
✅ **Unit economics are highly favorable**
✅ **Can afford aggressive customer acquisition**
✅ **Path to profitability is clear**

---

### Sensitivity Analysis

**What if CAC increases to $5?**
- LTV:CAC = $190 ÷ $5 = **38:1** (still excellent)
- Payback period = 0.53 months (~16 days)
- **Verdict:** Still very profitable

**What if churn increases to 8%?**
- LTV drops to $143 (Premium)
- LTV:CAC = $143 ÷ $3.50 = **41:1** (still strong)
- **Verdict:** Acceptable, but focus on retention

**What if conversion drops to 30%?**
- Need 133,000 installs (vs 95,000) over 4 months
- Increases total CAC spend by 40%
- **Verdict:** Still achievable, but margin tighter

---

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Risk 1: CAC Inflation**
- **Mitigation:** Diversify channels (don't rely on Meta alone)
- **Backup Plan:** Increase organic (ASO, content, referrals to 40%)

**Risk 2: Lower-Than-Expected Conversion**
- **Mitigation:** A/B test paywalls, trials, messaging constantly
- **Backup Plan:** Extend timeline to 5-6 months (still viable)

**Risk 3: High Churn**
- **Mitigation:** Retention campaigns, feature education, community
- **Backup Plan:** Implement pause options, lite plans, win-back offers

**Risk 4: Premium+ Underperformance**
- **Mitigation:** Focus on Premium volume (can hit $50K with Premium alone)
- **Backup Plan:** Adjust targets (90% Premium, 10% Premium+ is fine)
